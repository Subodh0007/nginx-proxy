‚úÖ Goal:

Replace all contents of the main branch with the current contents of the dev branch.
üîß Steps:

    Clone your repo (if not already cloned):

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

Fetch the latest changes from remote:

git fetch origin

Switch to the main branch:

git checkout main

Reset the main branch to match dev:

    This will make main look exactly like dev, including removing files that exist only in main.

git reset --hard origin/dev

Push the changes to GitHub:

    This overwrites main on GitHub to match dev.

    git push origin main --force

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:

    This process will overwrite history and content of the main branch.

    Only do this if you're okay with main being exactly like dev.

‚úÖ Alternative (if you want a merge instead):

If you just want to bring the changes from dev into main without replacing everything:

git checkout main
git merge dev
git push origin main

Let me know if you want to keep commit history or just overwrite contents ‚Äî I can tailor the steps.
